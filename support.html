                    <p>Dear Members of the Board,</p>
                    
                    <p>I am writing to share my concerns regarding the recent events between EBT and EBA. It deeply pains me to hear about the actions that the board members of EBT are conspiring against Viktoria Titova in an attempt to ultimately steal the business and the valuable contacts she has established over the last 17 years.</p>
                    
                    <p>Shame on you, Board members. Non-profits are supposed to contribute to the community, and you have failed in this task. Viktoria Titova built EBT and EBA from the ground up. While she has had support along the way, she does not deserve to be taken advantage of by the women and board members she chose to be on her team.</p>
                    
                    <p>I was a dancer with Viktoria from 2009 to 2015. Viktoria and I worked closely, and I deeply value and honor the woman and teacher she is. Viktoria has a kind and giving heart. It is despicable what the Board is doing to her during this time.</p>
                    
                    <p>I [..] often encounter philosophical questions related to the injustices of the human experience. This situation is an unfortunate example of unethical power and vile greed. If the Board members are successful in this seizure of resources, power, and control, it will greatly harm the community that has benefited from Viktoria's hard work and dedication.</p>
                    
                    <p>I urge all of you to set a healthy and positive example for the youth who benefit from your services. Look deep within yourselves and ask: Is this how I want to model business behavior, morals, and relationships?</p>
                    
                    <p>Sincerely,<br>
                    ******</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>Dear EBT Board of Directors,</p>
                    
                    <p>I am writing today to express my concerns with the current direction and actions of this Board. It would appear The Board intends to remove the person who founded and financially supported this organization since its inception. The fact that this person is an immigrant woman, who took a huge financial and personal risk to start this business, in not lost on the public. The optics of a hostile takeover of a profitable immigrant-owned business, built from the ground up, is not in the best interest of the Eastside arts community. Additionally, it is very clear that a 'theater production company' that is not partnering with a group of performers, is useless. This Board, by uncoupling from EBA, is either committing EBT to failure, or already has a plan to partner with a different entity. The future involvement of EBT with new or existing performance groups or schools will be under intense scrutiny that will be to the detriment of all parties. As someone who has worked with both organizations, and has participated with the school for more than a decade, I would encourage The Board to reflect on their personal motivations in this matter and remember that the optics of this situation have far reaching ramifications.</p>
                    <p>Thank you for your time. Respectfully, ******</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>Dear EBT Board,</p>
                    
                    <p>As a devoted member of the community and an attendee of Emerald Ballet Theatre performances over the past years, I urge you to reconsider your relationship with Viktoria Titova. She is an extremely talented dancer and an exceptional teacher to her students, thus representing both EBT and EBA as a professional and in the best interest of the community.</p>
                    
                    <p>Viktoria is the founder of both EBT and EBA and she serves as the backbone of these organizations. EBT and EBA are fundamentally her vision. To fulfill her dream and the development of both organizations, she hired talented and committed teachers and administrative staff. Removing Viktoria, the founder of these companies is, in my opinion, not in the best interest of the students and the community and doing so will cause disruptions and possibly chaos to the programs that will affect the students who are the main stakeholders.</p>
                    
                    <p>I urge you to exercise careful and professional thoughts as both organizations move forward for the sake of the students. If the board cannot agree with the founder, who has been instrumental in creating what currently exists within our community, then the board should consider another avenue and step aside by forming their own organization with bylaws. This would be in the best interest of both parties. The EBT community deserves a seamless transition during this time by adhering to professional and fair standards.</p>
                    
                    <p>Sincerely,<br>
                    ******</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>Dear Emerald Ballet's Board of Directors,</p>
                    
                    <p>I have heard via social media that there has been a misunderstanding in which it was assumed Ms. Viktoria is resigning, when that was not her intent. I urge you, the board, to reconsider your decision to remove Ms. Viktoria from the company. She is a gifted teacher and director and has left an enormous impact on many many students at EBT, including myself, who danced at EBT for many years. Without Ms. Viktoria's expertise, care, and perseverance, there would be no board for you to sit on. Removing her from the company will negatively impact your current students, and future students, for years to come.</p>
                    
                    <p>EBT's mission statement is the following: "Where dancing hearts are nurtured, and bodies are honed into instruments of strength and beauty". Ms. Viktoria embodies this statement perfectly. I was personally nurtured and honed by Ms. Viktoria myself, along with my sister and many of my friends, and my life would not be the same without her encouragement, discipline, and love.</p>
                    
                    <p>Whatever this misunderstanding was, I assure you, it is not worth it to jeopardize student's futures or to deny them the opportunity to learn from Ms. Viktoria. Please reconsider.</p>
                    
                    <p>Thank you,<br>******</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>I believe that it is imperative for Viktoria, the sole owner and creator of Emerald Ballet to remain on the board. Her opinions, thoughts and insight is important to the community, because she works on both sides. She knows the ins and outs of both theatre and academy and the needs of the community, students and families.</p>
                    
                    <p>Please work through issues and find harmony between both parties so that the community can remain intact and functional for the sake of many students and families that are now are a part of EBT and EBA, but also for those that have come before.</p>
                    
                    <p>I am an Emerald Ballet alumni and loved my ballet training at this beautiful institution. Would not have traded my experience there since the day it was founded until I graduated high school in 2016. I love this organization because it provided me with a clear path and skills to become a professional ballet dancer for 6 years. I became a Soloist with the company I danced for and I was able to flourish in many roles because Emerald Ballet had prepared me for all of the rigors but also all of the joys of the professional world.</p>
                    
                    <p>Please take a minute to listen to Viktoria, a crucial member of the board who should remain a valued member because of her vast knowledge, experience and love for the art of Ballet.</p>
                    
                    <p>Thank you,<br>******</p>

                    <p>To whom it may concern,</p>
                    
                    <p>I'm deeply concerned about the two conflicting emails I received from the EBT board and Ms.Viktoria. While organizational changes are sometimes necessary, the board's decisions being made without mutual agreement with Ms.Viktoria is troubling and upsetting.</p>
                    
                    <p>As parents of a dancer, our primary goal is ensuring that our children receive quality dance education and have ample performance opportunities. EBT and EBA have collaborated effectively for many years, and we do not understand the sudden need for them to separate.</p>
                    
                    <p>I strongly urge the board to work with Ms. Viktoria to reach a mutual decision before disseminating any further information. This will help ensure minimal disruption to our dancers, teachers, and the parent community.</p>

                    <p>Good Morning,</p>
                    
                    <p>This email was a shock at the minimum to say. It is absolutely unspeakable even to think about this possibility. We sincerely hope the information stated in the email above was sent by some horrific mistake.</p>
                    
                    <p>To my knowledge, Viktoria Titova has founded Emerald Ballet Theatre (EBT in 2007) and has established Emerald Ballet Academy (EBA in 2010). Victoria Titova explicitly and clearly stated in her email which came on the same day (June 01, 2024) right after this email was sent that she did not resign from any roles.</p>
                    
                    <p>Why is this email stating that Victoria has been removed from the positions?</p>
                    
                    <p>We are a part of EBA and EBT family for about ten years as our daughter goes to this school. Coming to one of the EBT performances more than ten years ago inspired us to try and join EBA & EBT family. When our daughter has just joined this school, her first classes were with Victoria, and this is why we decided to continue staying with the school.</p>
                    
                    <p>We firmly disagree with this attempt to remove her from the board of Emerald Ballet Theatre without due process.</p>
                    
                    <p>We request that the board pause, listen, and resolve any issues without tearing our EBA and EBT community apart.</p>
                    
                    <p>Sincerely,<br>******</p>

                    <p>Hi EBT Board members,</p>
                    
                    <p>Like many other parents and students of EBA, I am very confused and concerned with the recent news that Viktoria Titova is no longer a part of EBT and that EBT will be separated from EBA. I am not sure how or why anyone would want the 2 organizations to be separate since without a dance school you can not have students for performances and without performance opportunities it is hard to keep a dance school going. I feel like the parents are only getting part of the story and that the truth lies somewhere in between the versions we have heard so far via the emails sent by both parties.</p>
                    
                    <p>I believe the board owes it to the families and students (and facility) of EBA to provide the full story on what is going on, why it is going on and what the full impact is to the school and students.</p>
                    
                    <p>EBA and EBT have been a huge part of my daughters life for the past 6 years (not to mention myself and the rest of my family). She loves dancing and performing with this community.</p>
                    
                    <p>I hope that the Board takes some time to really think through the full impact of its actions and be more transparent with the EBA and EBT community on the what and why behind this situation. The communication has been unclear and incomplete and has created a lot of uncertainty across the community.</p>
                    
                    <p>Thank you for taking the time to hear my concerns.<br>******</p>

                    <p>Respected EBT Board Members,</p>
                    
                    <p>Our family is a part of the EBT/EBA community for 11+ years. My children started dancing with the school in 2013 right after their 4th birthday. Opportunity to perform from an early age in front of a big audience, with life orchestra is a big part of the learning experience.</p>
                    
                    <p>A year after my children joined the Emerald Ballet they invited a friend to a Nutcracker performance and the friend also became a long term member of EBA family. Some other friends were joining EBA as short term students by request of their trainers (artistic gymnastics, synchronous swimming, ice skating). They all came for very specific reason - they knew Ms Viktoria's background in classical ballet training and teaching.</p>
                    
                    <p>Ms Viktoria is well known in the dance world. A few years ago I had a patient who was a professional (not classical ballet) dancer. When during our interaction I briefly mentioned about my 5 year old kids attending EBA, she immediately knew the school and highly appraised Viktoria's artistic and teaching skills: "they will be lucky to learn from Viktoria. Her dancing techniques and organizational skills are amazing".</p>
                    
                    <p>At YAGP finals in April of this year the large ensemble was taking pictures after performing "Summer". Larissa Saveliev (YAGP Artistic Director, Founder) was walking by; when she saw Viktoria with her the EBA family Larissa asked to join the group for a mutual picture. Before leaving us she addressed the students: "Hold on to her [pointing at Viktoria]. She is the best".</p>
                    
                    <p>No needs to remind the school is recognised multiple times as outstanding school. Please pause the EBT structural re-organization and bring this discussion to the larger EBT/EBA community. We as parents need to understand what is happening at EBA/EBT and what is best for our children. We would very appreciate having us involved in discussion. Ms Viktoria who has been a leader of these organizations for many years has proved her devotion.</p>
                    
                    <p>Sincerely,<br>******</p>

                    <p>From a concerned community member, clearly the actions described in this email are not within the best interest of EBT and EBA, and Viktoria Tivota's wishes are not to be removed from the board of EBT. I respectfully ask the Board to resolve any internal conflicts so that these wonderful organizations can continue to build culture and art within the community together.</p>
                    
                    <p>My preschool daughter started ballet with EBA last year, and the EBT recitals/performances this past winter and spring have ignited her love for dance. I would hate for your internal conflicts to affect the wonderful opportunities to which my daughter has access through the Academy and its partnerships.</p>
                    
                    <p>I see Viktoria lovingly teaching and preparing with the dancers at EBA. Though I don't personally know her, I see her passion and care from afar. Please take the time to reconsider these actions.</p>
                    
                    <p>Respectfully,<br>******</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
                    
                    <p>I disagree with this attempt to remove Ms Viktoria from the board of Emerald Ballet Theatre without due process.</p>
                    
                    <p>I request that the board pause, listen to what's best for the community, and resolve any outstanding issues between EBT and EBA without tearing our community apart.</p>
                    
                    <p>This impromptu decision is hurting the whole EBT or EBA community.</p>

                    <p>Dear Board Members,</p>
                    
                    <p>As one of the longest-standing members of the EBT community, I, ******, have been deeply involved since my older daughter started her ballet classes with Viktoria Titova in 2008. With my youngest daughter now in her fifth year of dancing, I have witnessed firsthand Viktoria Titova's unwavering professionalism, dedication, loyalty, and commitment to serving our community through the art of ballet.</p>
                    
                    <p>I urge you to stand up against any attempt to remove Viktoria Titova from the board of Emerald Ballet Theatre. Her presence is invaluable, and her contributions have been integral to the success and reputation of our ballet school and any associated the theatre activities.</p>
                    
                    <p>Furthermore, I urge the board to reconsider its communication methods and prioritize open dialogue and collaboration. Effective communication is vital for resolving any existing issues between EBT and EBA, and it is essential to consider the potential impact on our ballet community, students, and the reputation of all involved parties.</p>
                    
                    <p>I encourage each of you to support due process and embrace a community-driven approach. Thank you for your attention to this matter.</p>
                    
                    <p>Sincerely,<br>******</p>
