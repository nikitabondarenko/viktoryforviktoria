            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>This is a plea for help for an immigrant woman who spent 17 years building two thriving ballet companies -- one nonprofit, one for-profit. The Board of the nonprofit, acting illegally and with personal motivations, wrongfully fired the founder from all her positions.</p>
            <p>Her story needs to be heard. Read it. Share it. Speak out. And if you can, consider making a small contribution to help cover her legal costs.</p>

            <h2>The Story</h2>
            
            <h3>The Beginning (2007-2019)</h3>
            <div class="story-section">
                <p>Ms. Viktoria Titova, a former Bolshoi Ballet ballerina, founded Emerald Ballet Theatre (EBT), a nonprofit organization, in 2007 and Emerald Ballet Academy (EBA), a for-profit ballet school, in 2010. Viktoria single-handedly built EBT and EBA from ground up, recruiting talented teachers and staff. The two entities complemented each other perfectly — one focused on nurturing students, while the other brought their talents to life on stage through stunning performances.</p>
                <p>She pursuit this dream with immense financial and personal sacrifice, working tirelessly -- without vacations or proper compensation -- to provide the Seattle arts community with the highest level of ballet education.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>The Beginning of Changes (2019)</h3>
            <div class="story-section">
                <p>In 2019, one of Viktoria's teachers, Erin McEachran, whom she had hired and mentored for years, suggested adding her father, James McEachran, to the EBT Board. This would prove to be a fateful decision. Five years later, James orchestrated Viktoria's ousting—paving the way for his daughter to take her place.</p>
