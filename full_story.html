            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>This is a plea for help for an immigrant woman who spent 17 years building two thriving ballet companies -- one nonprofit, one for-profit. The Board of the nonprofit, acting illegally and with personal motivations, wrongfully fired the founder from all her positions.</p>
            <p>Her story needs to be heard. Read it. Share it. Speak out. And if you can, consider making a small contribution to help cover her legal costs.</p>

            <h2>The Story</h2>
            
            <h3>The Beginning (2007-2019)</h3>
            <div class="story-section">
                <p>Ms. Viktoria Titova, a former Bolshoi Ballet ballerina, founded Emerald Ballet Theatre (EBT), a nonprofit organization, in 2007 and Emerald Ballet Academy (EBA), a for-profit ballet school, in 2010. Viktoria single-handedly built EBT and EBA from ground up, recruiting talented teachers and staff. The two entities complemented each other perfectly — one focused on nurturing students, while the other brought their talents to life on stage through stunning performances.</p>
                <p>She pursuit this dream with immense financial and personal sacrifice, working tirelessly -- without vacations or proper compensation -- to provide the Seattle arts community with the highest level of ballet education.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>The Beginning of Changes (2019)</h3>
            <div class="story-section">
                <p>In 2019, one of Viktoria's teachers, Erin McEachran, whom she had hired and mentored for years, suggested adding her father, James McEachran, to the EBT Board. This would prove to be a fateful decision. Five years later, James orchestrated Viktoria's ousting—paving the way for his daughter to take her place.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Troubling Signs (Spring 2024)</h3>
            <div class="story-section">
                <p>By spring 2024, Viktoria began noticing troubling signs. Despite record enrollment, prestigious competition awards, a successful performance season, and a $300,000 surplus in EBT's bank account, the Board seemed determined to find "issues" with her leadership. Several EBA/EBT employees were openly engaging in acts of sabotage.</p>
                <p>On May 1, the Board informed Viktoria that they were considering removing her from all EBT roles—under the pretense of "giving her more time to search for a new studio." Another time, a Board member proposed buying out Viktoria and "bringing EBA under EBT."</p>
            </div>

            <h3>The Language Barrier Issue</h3>
            <div class="story-section">
                <p>As the confrontation escalated, Viktoria took two crucial steps. First, she requested an interpreter for Board meetings. English is not her native language, and under stress, it was challenging to interpret conversations and respond quickly—especially when discussing intricate legal and financial matters. Her request was denied three times. As a result, she was left without an interpreter during the critical Board meetings on May 21 and May 31.</p>
                <p>The Board eventually relented—but only after an attorney intervened, stating: "Failure to accommodate this reasonable request would constitute discrimination against an otherwise proven capable director over the last 17 years."</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Community Response</h3>
            <div class="story-section">
                <p>Viktoria appealed directly to the EBA/EBT community. Students, parents, and supporters wrote numerous letters expressing their shock and disappointment over the Board's actions: "the board members of EBT are conspiring ...in an attempt to ultimately steal the business", "a hostile takeover of a profitable immigrant-owned business", "an unfortunate example of unethical power and vile greed". One after another, the letters urged the Board to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Not fire Viktoria</li>
                    <li>Not separate EBA and EBT</li>
                    <li>Not tear the community apart</li>
                    <li>Communicate openly and transparently</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>The Illegal Termination (June 4-5, 2024)</h3>
            <div class="story-section">
                <p>The Board disregarded the community and fired Viktoria during a marathon meeting spanning June 4–5, 2024. The meeting itself was bizarre. Viktoria made it clear she was willing to do whatever was necessary to keep both companies together. For the first four hours, the Board pretended to work toward a resolution. Then, after extracting all the information they wanted, the Board's tone suddenly shifted.</p>
                
                <h4>The Illegal Process:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The secretary rapidly read a pre-written motion to remove Viktoria from all positions</li>
                    <li>Three fabricated reasons were cited: spreading rumors, threatening to resign, and disrespectful treatment of staff</li>
                    <li>No evidence was presented</li>
                    <li>EBT's bylaws require a 'for-cause' termination, yet no valid justification was ever provided</li>
                    <li>The vote violated Washington State law (RCW Section 24.03a.530(2)(b))</li>
                    <li>Required 48-hour notice for director removal was not given</li>
                    <li>The Board was informed of this legal requirement but proceeded with the vote anyway—a deliberate and blatant violation of Washington State law</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Conflicts of Interest:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Board member James McEachran had a direct conflict—his daughter was set to replace Viktoria</li>
                    <li>He acknowledged this conflict but refused to recuse himself</li>
                    <li>Actively participated in all critical votes</li>
                    <li>The Board ignored these clear breaches of fiduciary duty</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>The Decision Makers:</h4>
                <p>The disastrous decision to split the two companies was made by three unqualified individuals—with zero ballet knowledge, business experience limited to a few Zoom meetings, and questionable ethics.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>The Aftermath</h3>
            <div class="story-section">
                <h4>Impact on EBT:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Only about 10% of students remained</li>
                    <li>First time in 17 years without a proper Nutcracker performance</li>
                    <li>Community bitterly divided</li>
                    <li>Mini-Nutcracker staged in a shopping mall with copied choreography</li>
                    <li>Erin McEachran appointed as Artistic Director, with the Board declaring: "Erin is both an artistic visionary and a dedicated educator. Her ability to orchestrate engaging, immersive performances is matched only by her gift for fostering a welcoming environment where every student can reach their fullest potential."</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Board Changes:</h4>
                <p>Of the original four Board members, only James McEachran still remains. Those who plotted Viktoria's removal abandoned the ship soon after. McEachran, however, will likely cling to his seat for as long as his daughter needs him, regardless of the glaring conflict of interest.</p>

                <h4>Impact on EBA:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lost studio space</li>
                    <li>Lost all costumes</li>
                    <li>Faced overwhelming legal fees</li>
                    <li>Endured continued attempts to damage business</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
