            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>This is a plea for help for an immigrant woman who spent 17 years building two thriving ballet companies — one nonprofit, one for-profit. The Board of the nonprofit, acting with personal motivations and in conflict with state laws, fired the founder from all her positions.</p>
            <p>The nonprofit then began competing directly with the other company.</p>
            <p>Her story of betrayal, ethical failure, and injustice needs to be heard. <strong>Read it. Share it. Speak out.</strong> And if you can, consider making a small contribution to help cover her legal costs.</p>

            <h2>Story</h2>
            
            <h3>Beginning (2007-2019)</h3>
            <div class="story-section">
                <p><strong>Ms. Viktoria Titova,</strong> a former Bolshoi Ballet ballerina, founded <strong>Emerald Ballet Theatre (EBT)</strong>, a nonprofit organization, in 2007 and <strong>Emerald Ballet Academy (EBA)</strong>, a for-profit ballet school, in 2010.</strong> Viktoria single-handedly built EBT and EBA from the ground up, recruiting talented teachers and staff. The two entities complemented each other perfectly — one focused on nurturing students, while the other brought their talents to life on stage through stunning performances.</p>
                <p>She pursued this dream with immense financial and personal sacrifice, working tirelessly — without vacations or proper compensation — to provide the Seattle arts community with the highest level of ballet education.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>A New Board Member (2019)</h3>
            <div class="story-section">
                <p>In 2019, Viktoria's longtime teacher Erin McEachran — whom she had mentored for years — suggested adding her father to the EBT Board. It would prove to be a fateful decision. Five years later, James McEachran played a key role in Viktoria's ousting, paving the way for his daughter to take her place as School Director and Artistic Director.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Troubling Signs (Spring 2024)</h3>
            <div class="story-section">
                <p>By spring 2024, Viktoria began noticing troubling signs. Despite record enrollment, a successful performance season, and a $300,000 surplus in EBT's bank account, the Board seemed determined to find "issues" with her leadership. Several EBA/EBT employees were seemingly engaging in actions that undermined her work.</p>
                <p>On May 1, the Board informed Viktoria that they were considering removing her from all EBT roles — under the pretense of "giving her more time to search for a new studio." As if searching for a new studio somehow made her incapable of performing her regular duties. In another instance, a Board member proposed "buying out" Viktoria's own company and "bringing EBA under EBT." Seemingly, the Board was looking for ways to push Viktoria out.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Discrimination Issue</h3>
            <div class="story-section">
                <p>As the confrontation escalated, Viktoria took two crucial steps. First, she requested an interpreter for Board meetings. English is not her native language, and under stress, it was challenging to interpret conversations and respond quickly — especially when discussing intricate legal and financial matters. The Board denied her request three times. As a result, she was left without an interpreter during the critical meetings on May 21 and May 31.</p>
                <p>The Board eventually relented — but only after an attorney intervened, stating: <em>"Failure to accommodate this reasonable request would constitute <strong>discrimination</strong> against an otherwise proven capable director over the last 17 years."</em></p>
            </div>

            <h3>Community Response</h3>
            <div class="story-section">
                <p>Second, Viktoria appealed directly to the EBA/EBT community. Students, parents, and supporters wrote numerous letters expressing their shock and disappointment over the Board's actions: </p>
                    <li><em>"the board members of EBT are conspiring [...] in an attempt to ultimately steal the business"</em></li>
                    <li><em>"a hostile takeover of a profitable immigrant-owned business"</em></li>
                    <li><em>"an unfortunate example of unethical power and vile greed"</em></li>
                    <li><em>"Shame on you, Board members. Non-profits are supposed to contribute to the community, and you have failed in this task"</em></li>
                    <li><em>"Without Ms. Viktoria's expertise, care, and perseverance, there would be no board for you to sit on"</em></li>
                    
                <p>Read the full <a href="support.html">community letters to the Board</a>. One after another, the letters urged the Board to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Not fire Viktoria</li>
                    <li>Not separate EBA and EBT</li>
                    <li>Not tear the community apart</li>
                    <li>Communicate openly and transparently</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Wrongful Termination (June 4-5, 2024)</h3>
            <div class="story-section">
                <p>The Board arrogantly disregarded the overwhelming outcry from the community and fired Viktoria during a marathon meeting spanning June 4–5, 2024. The meeting itself was bizarre and deceitful. Viktoria made it clear she was willing to do whatever was necessary to keep both companies together. For the first four hours, the Board pretended to work toward a resolution. Then, after extracting all the information they wanted, the Board's tone suddenly shifted, as if by a cue.</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>The secretary rapidly read a pre-written motion to remove Viktoria from all positions</li>
                    <li>Three unsubstantiated reasons were cited — spreading rumors, threatening to resign, and disrespectful treatment of staff. No evidence was presented. Importantly, these claims were unrelated to any prior disagreements between Viktoria and the Board</li>
                    <li>No meaningful discussion followed. The Board members clearly knew in advance how they would vote — it was an ambush </li>
                    <li>Viktoria was wrongfully removed from her board position. The vote was <strong>in clear conflict</strong> with Washington State law <strong>RCW Section 24.03a.530(2)(b)</strong></li>
                    <li>The required 48-hour notice for the director's removal was not given</li>
                    <li>The Board was made aware of this legal requirement but hastily proceeded with the vote anyway, which likely constitutes a breach of <strong>fiduciary duty</strong></li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Severe Conflict of Interest</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Board member James McEachran had a direct and undisputed conflict — his daughter was set to replace Viktoria</li>
                    <li>He acknowledged this conflict but refused to recuse himself and actively participated in all critical votes and discussions</li>
                    <li>The rest of the Board, despite being fully aware, did nothing. They too likely violated fundamental <strong>ethical</strong> and <strong>fiduciary</strong> responsibilities</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Three Votes</h4>
                <p>Three unqualified individuals — with no ballet background, business experience limited to a few Zoom meetings, and questionable ethics — voted to split the two companies and to tear apart an entire community.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Aftermath</h3>
            <p>Immediately after the firing, EBT escalated tensions by cutting off EBA's access to critical shared digital infrastructure — despite years of cooperation between the two entities. Eventually, EBT launched its own ballet school, copying the same business model, and competing directly with EBA. With a similar name, access to all clients, and after forcing EBA from its longtime studio, it appeared EBT was attempting to absorb most or all of EBA's business.</p>
            <div class="story-section">
                <h4>Impact on EBT</h4>
                <p>But this clever scheme did not succeed, as only about 10% of students remained with EBT. The community was bitterly divided. For the first time in 17 years, the production company had no Nutcracker performance. The disastrous consequences were predictable — except, apparently, to the geniuses from the Board.</p>
                <h4>Plagiarism:</h4>
                <p>EBT did stage a mini-Nutcracker in a shopping mall. This "community" performance was directed by Erin McEachran who blatantly copied Viktoria's original choreography. Ballet professionals and community members noted striking similarities in movement, staging, and structure. </p>
                <p>Shortly afterward, the Board appointed Erin as Artistic Director, declaring: <em>"Erin is an artistic visionary."</em></p>
                <p>An artistic visionary? Who can only plagiarize someone else's work? The perfect person to lead the new EBT.</p>

                <h4>Board Changes</h4>
                <p>Of the original four members, only <strong>James McEachran</strong> still remains on the Board. Those who were so eager to remove Viktoria and dismantle the successful partnership between the two companies quickly abandoned ship — nowhere to be found now that the damage is done. But McEachran will likely cling to his seat for as long as his daughter depends on him — regardless of the glaring conflict of interest.</p>

                <h4>Impact on EBA</h4>
                <p>EBA also suffered devastating losses. Viktoria was forced out of her studio and had to secure a new space on short notice. She lost all costumes. Legal fees have been overwhelming, and she was forced to take on an enormous personal loan. Meanwhile, EBT continued actions that undermined EBA's business.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Viktoria's Resilience and Triumph</h3>
            <div class="story-section">
                <p>But Viktoria is a survivor—and once again, she rose to the challenge. Most of the talented, professional, and principled teachers chose to stand by her. The vast majority of families followed EBA, refusing to abandon the woman who had shaped their children's artistic journeys.</p>

                <p>The entire community — teachers, staff, students, and parents — rallied with remarkable unity. In just weeks, over 200 costumes were sewn or altered by a newly formed Costume Team. Parent volunteers stepped in at every turn. Teachers and dancers poured their hearts into every role. What they accomplished was nothing short of miraculous!</p>

                <p>In <strong>December 2024</strong>, EBA triumphantly staged four spectacular Nutcracker performances — with a live orchestra, dazzling new sets, and a breathtaking guest dancer (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/balletdude/">link</a>). <strong>The 20th anniversary</strong> of Viktoria's choreography was her most magical production to date.</p>

                <p>In <strong>January 2025</strong>, EBA students dominated the <strong>Youth America Grand Prix (YAGP)</strong>, winning top awards across multiple categories. EBA also earned the prestigious "Outstanding Teacher" Award—a distinction given to only two ballet schools.</p>
